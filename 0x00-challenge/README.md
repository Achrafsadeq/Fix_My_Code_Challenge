 # 0x00. Fix My Code

## **Description**

This project, **Fix My Code**, presents an exciting challenge where we dive into existing codebases and resolve issues within them. It's an opportunity to work with unfamiliar languages and debug code effectively. Unlike typical projects, this one is 100% optional and serves as a great way to improve skills while boosting your project score.  

You will:
- Analyze and debug code written in Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and C.
- Fix specific issues to meet the expected output.
- Focus on improving the quality and correctness of existing codebases.

## **Learning Objectives**

By completing this project, you will:
- Understand the importance of debugging and problem-solving in software development.
- Enhance your ability to work with code written by others.
- Improve your debugging skills in various programming languages.
- Learn to focus on the root cause of issues without rewriting the entire codebase.

## **Background Context**

The **Fix My Code** project tests your ability to debug existing code efficiently. The goal is not to rewrite the code but to pinpoint the issue and fix it. This simulates real-world scenarios where you encounter legacy systems or collaborate on a shared codebase.
