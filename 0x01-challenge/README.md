# 0x01. Fix My Code Challenge

## **Description**

The **Fix My Code Challenge** is an advanced debugging project where you’ll dive into existing codebases across multiple languages and frameworks to identify and fix issues. This project is designed to simulate real-world scenarios where you encounter legacy systems or collaborate on shared codebases. The goal is not to rewrite the code but to pinpoint and resolve specific issues efficiently.

This project is **100% optional** and serves as an excellent way to improve your debugging skills while boosting your project score. Have fun while learning!

## **Learning Objectives**

By completing this project, you will:
- Enhance your ability to debug code in unfamiliar languages and frameworks.
- Learn to identify and fix issues without rewriting the entire codebase.
- Gain experience working with real-world codebases and frameworks like Flask, Python, Ruby on Rails, and React.
- Improve your problem-solving and critical-thinking skills in software development.

## **Background Context**

The **Fix My Code Challenge** is designed to test your ability to debug and improve existing codebases. You’ll encounter code written in various languages and frameworks, some of which you may not be familiar with. The goal is to identify the root cause of issues and fix them without rewriting the entire codebase. This simulates real-world scenarios where you work with legacy systems or collaborate on shared projects.
